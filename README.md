fastest, lightweightest, slickiest, damn good framework!! See what the users

Getting Started
---------------
If you wish, you can clone or download it to your project. But if I were you,
I'd just copy and paste the code at the start of your `script.js` file. Yeah,
I know you named it like that. Everyone does.

EDIT: OOOORRR you add the newly added cdn! (because I just discovers how they
work and this is awesome) Just copy and paste the code bellow at, well,
anywhere you like, I personally suggest you above the `<title>` tag.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vhoyer/jQ@1.0.0/jQ.js"></script>
```

Contrbiuting
-----------
Just try to be as succinct as possible, don't bother it being readable, that's
overestimated! xD. OOOORR you can just correct a typo, like that one at the
section title. That's a classic. And **remember** to keep each feature in one
different line, just because. Actually, for aesthetics proposes.
